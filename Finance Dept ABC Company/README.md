## 👉Business Case: 
The Finance Department of ABC Company maintains the invoice level details of all Payroll vendors and the cost associated with generating payslips for their employees. The Analyst receives invoices for each vendor and he fills all the details from each invoice in an excel sheet. He along with his colleagues collects similar data for all the countries and collates that information in one spreadsheet. The Global Finance leader along with other Country-level Finance leaders seeks data from these analysts to identify the Per Payslip Costs (PPC), that helps them in negotiating with vendors to reduce overall cost for the company. 

## 👉Problem Statement: 
Since data is being captured for different regions by separate analysts there is no way the Global leader could view the real-time global metrics, he has to wait for all the Country/Region-specific leaders to share their metrics with him and it only happens once a month. Your manager has got a request to build a global dashboard with some key metrics, that can be one source of truth for all regions. Your manager has assigned this task to you to collate all the Region-specific sheets in one file, clean all unwanted data and map it with the other master tables and create an automated dashboard solution that can serve all.

## 👉Dataset Description:
- Country-wise Detailed information on Vendor Charges/fees ( Regional Table1, Regional Table2)
- Country-wise Payslip Information (Payslips)
- Master Mapping table – Country – Region – Vendor Name (Mapping)
- Summary Table consists of Monthly summary of cost as well as payslip information.
