      The key to success in any organization is attracting and retaining top talent. Iâ€™m an HR analyst at my company, and one of my tasks is to determine which factors keep employees at my company and which prompt others to leave. 
I need to know what factors I can change to prevent the loss of good people. Watson Analytics is going to help.

          I have data about past and current employees in a spreadsheet on my desk top. It has various data points on our employees, but Iâ€™m most interested in whether theyâ€™re still with my company or whether theyâ€™ve gone to work somewhere else. 
And I want to understand how this relates to workforce attrition

ðŸ‘‰ This dataset is taking from kaggle and done some EDA and changes done on the excel.

ðŸ‘‰ Result :

The highest attrition occurred among employees with 0-10 years of experience (182 employees), while those with 31+ years of experience had very low attrition (5 employees). A significant portion of attrition (61%) was attributed to employees leaving due to distance to work. Job dissatisfaction was a notable reason for attrition, with 73 employees leaving for this reason, even though 46 were satisfied but still left the company. Most attrition occurred at Level 1 job positions, with 143 employees leaving. The R&D department had the highest attrition rate, while HR had the lowest. Male employees had a higher attrition rate compared to females, with 150 male employees leaving. Specific job roles also impacted attrition, with Laboratory Technicians having the highest attrition (62), followed by Sales Executives. Employees below the age of 35, including freshers, had the highest attrition, while those above 56 years of age tended to stay longer in the organization.
